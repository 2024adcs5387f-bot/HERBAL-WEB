3. Backend enriches results with medicinal data:
   - Queries Supabase medicinal_plants table
   - Falls back to hardcoded database
   - Adds safety information
4. Enhanced data returned to frontend
5. Frontend displays comprehensive medicinal information
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  plant_name: "Turmeric",
  medicinal_uses: ["Anti-inflammatory", "Antioxidant", ...],
  active_compounds: ["Curcumin", "Turmerone", ...],
  traditional_uses: ["Used in Ayurvedic medicine...", ...],
  modern_applications: ["Clinical trials for arthritis...", ...],
