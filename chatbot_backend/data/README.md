# Data Folder

Place your preprocessed model/data files here. The service will look for these exact filenames:

- all_unique_symptoms.pkl
- disease_symptom_map.pkl
- herb_symptom_map.pkl
- df_precaution_cleaned.csv
- post_info_map.pkl

No sample data is included. These files are required for full functionality.

You can set a custom location with the `DATA_DIR` environment variable; otherwise, this folder is used by default.
